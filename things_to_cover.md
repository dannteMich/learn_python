**Intro** - Who am I, what I'm doing, what is python and why choose it and so on.
  - A little about our first environment - the web environment
  - An intro to basic types, `print` and `input`

### Project 1: The guessing game

- **First Project - The guessing game** - all done in the web IDE
  - Getting input and printing output
  - Getting a random number
  - The `while` loop
    - doing with a `while` loop with a real condition
    - doing with a `while` loop with a `true` and a `break` condition
  - `if`s and flow control.

- **Upgrade 1** - Working in a real env, with a real editor/IDE
- **Upgrade 2** - lets do this with `argparse`
