# Class 02 - Putting it all together

This exercise is done without using classes, at least in the first versions.


## Knowledge required
- `list`s and `dict`ionaries
- `str`ings
  - With some basic functions with strings
- Loops (`while` and `for`) and conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- `input` and `print`
- Functions

### packages required
All packages used for this exercise are build it, and not all of those have to be used.

- required packages:
  - `argparse`
- optional packages:
  - `random`
  - `collections`
  - `json`

### notes:
- This exercise can be made a bit simpler by using `OrderedDict` from the `collections` module, but it is not necessary.


## Things to go over in the lecture
- [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/)
- ChatGPT/gemini - at least for generating inputs
- string functions
- `while` and `for` loops reminders
- opening and reading files
