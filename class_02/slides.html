# Basic Python Reminders

---



# Agenda

1. I/O - `input` and `print`
1. conditionals - `if`, `elif`, `else`
1. Strings
 - And useful methods
1. `list`s and useful methods
1. `dict`s and useful methods
1. loops - `for` and `while`
1. functions - `def`
 - arguments
 - `return`s (and not returns)
 - `pass`

---

# Before everything else

## Where do I get info?

--

1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
--

1. Google (which will point you to Stack Overflow)
--

1. [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/)
  - Save it to a bookmark/favorite, and configure your most used languages/packages
--

1. ChatGPT
--

1. [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) (which will probably give you an answer based on Stack Overflow)

# Output and Input

---

# Output

Done using `print`

```python
print("Hello world!")

# output: Hello world!
```
--


can print multiple types, seperated by commas

```python
num = 3
b = True
print("Hello", "world!", num, b, 3.14)

# output: Hello world! 3 True 3.14
```
--

<br/>
.callout-blue[**Reminder**: Always line-breaks at the end]

---

# Input

Done using the `input`

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
# name is a str
```

--

**Important**: return value is always a `str` and YOU need to cast it

```python
age = input("What is your age? ") # age is a str
age = int(age) # age is now an int
```
--

Or in 1 line so that the variable does not change types
```python
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
```

--

<br/>
.callout-blue[**Reminder**: Also always line-breaks at the end]

class: center, middle, inverse

# Conditionals

---

# `if` and his family

Basic structure is simple:

```python
if <condition-1>:
    # do something
elif <condition-2>:
    # do something else
elif <condition-3>
    # do another something else
else:
    # All other cases
```

- Conditions are checked **in order**
- If you use `elif` and `if`, Only one clause will get executed

---

# Lets look at an example

Take a minute to look at this code

```python
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x % 3 == 0:
    print("Multiple of 3")
elif x < -20:
    print("Small negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

--

- for `x == 10`:
--
 `Positive`
--

- for `x == 9`:
--
 `Positive`
--

- for `x == -6`:
--
 `Multiple of 3`
--

- for `x == 0`:
--
 `multiple of 3`
--

- for `x == -21`:
--
 `multiple of 3`
--

- for `x == -7`:
--
 `zero`
--

- for `x == -22`:
--
 `Small negative`

--

Aaaaaand that's it!

# Strings

---

# String Basics

```python
my_str = "hello strings"
```

--

- **access**
```python
my_str[0] # h
my_str[1] # e
my_str[-1] # s
my_str[-2] # g
```

--

- **slicing**
```python
s = my_str[0:5] # s == hello
```

--

- **`len`**
```python
length = len(my_str) # length == 13
```

--

- **concatenation**
```python
new_str = my_str + " are fun" # new_str == "hello strings are fun"
```
---

# Some important points

--

- No such thing as a **`char`** in Python - only strings of length 1
    ```python
    my_char = "a"
    len(my_char) # 1
    type(my_char) # <class 'str'>
    ```



- Strings can be empty
  ```python
  empty_str = ""
  len(empty_str) # 0
  ```

--

- Strings are immutable
  ```python
  my_str = "Hello"
  my_str[0] = "h" # Error
  ```


  
---

# Some useful methods and properties

you can find all of these on devdocs.io under in the [string section](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#str)

Some examples:

--


- **Manipulation**

  - `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`
  - `strip`
  - `replace`
  - `split`
  
--

- **Testing**
  - `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isalnum`
  - `startswith`, `endswith`

--

- **Searching**
  - `find`, `index`
  - `count`

--

These are only partial examples, there are many more!

# Lists

---

# Lists

An ordered collection of items
```python
l = [1, 40, -4, 0, 365]
print(l[1]) # 40
````

- Can hold multiple types of items
  - But this is usually **a BAD idea**
- **Mutable** - can be changed
    ```python
    l[2] = 0
    print(l) # [1, 40, 0, 0, 365]
    ```

---

# Useful methods and properties of lists

- Quick copy with slicing `[:]`
  ```python
  l = [1, 2, 3]
  l2 = l[:] # this is different from l2 = l  
  ```
- check if something is `in`
  ```python
  if 1 in l:
      print("1 is in the list")

  if 4 not in l:
      print("4 is not in the list")
  ```
--

- [common sequence methods](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#typesseq-mutable) and [mutable sequence methods](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#typesseq-mutable)
--

- Additional method:  [`sort`](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#list.sort) - **in place**

--

- `join` - **not** a list method, but a string method that takes a list as an argument, and prints it's elements with the string as a separator
  ```python
  "-->>".join(l) # "1-->>40-->>0-->>0-->>365"
  ```

## A minute to talk about
# Slicing

---

# Slicing

- Allows to create a new collection from some part of an existing *sequential* collection
  - Won't work on 'dict' and 'set'
- Creates a **new** collection and **does not** change the original

- syntax:

## A minute to talk about
# (Im)Mutability

---

# Mutable vs. Immutable

`list`s are mutable - you can change them

```python
l = [1,2,3]
l[1] = "two"
print(l) # 1, "two", 3
```

--

`str`ings are immutable - you cant change them.
```python
s = "hello"
s[1] = 't' # Throws an error
```
--
You can, however, create a new string
```python
s2 = s[:2] + "r" + s[3:] 
print(s2) # s is not "heklo"
```

# `str` is a weird collection!

It's a collection of itself...

# Here be Dragons

```python

  l2 = l[:]
  l3 = l # This is a reference. they do not point to the same object
