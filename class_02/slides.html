1. conditionals - `if`, `elif`, `else`
1. Strings
 - And useful methods
1. `list`s and useful methods
1. `dict`s and useful methods
1. loops - `for` and `while`
1. functions - `def`
 - arguments
 - `return`s (and not returns)
 - `pass`

---

# Before everything else

## Where do I get info?

--

1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
--

1. Google (which will point you to Stack Overflow)
--

1. [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/)
  - Save it to a bookmark/favorite, and configure your most used languages/packages
--

1. ChatGPT
--

1. [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) (which will probably give you an answer based on Stack Overflow)

# Output and Input

---

# Output

Done using `print`

```python
print("Hello world!")

# output: Hello world!
```
--


can print multiple types, seperated by commas

```python
num = 3
b = True
print("Hello", "world!", num, b, 3.14)

# output: Hello world! 3 True 3.14
```
--

<br/>
.callout-blue[**Reminder**: Always line-breaks at the end]

---

# Input

Done using the `input`

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
# name is a str
```

--

**Important**: return value is always a `str` and YOU need to cast it

```python
age = input("What is your age? ") # age is a str
age = int(age) # age is now an int
```
--

Or in 1 line so that the variable does not change types
```python
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
```

--

<br/>
.callout-blue[**Reminder**: Also always line-breaks at the end]

class: center, middle, inverse

# Conditionals

---

# `if` and his family

Basic structure is simple:

```python
if <condition-1>:
    # do something
elif <condition-2>:
    # do something else
elif <condition-3>
    # do another something else
else:
    # All other cases
```

- Conditions are checked **in order**
- If you use `elif` and `if`, Only one clause will get executed

---

# Lets look at an example

Take a minute to look at this code

```python
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x % 3 == 0:
    print("Multiple of 3")
elif x < -20:
    print("Small negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

--

- for `x == 10`:
--
 `Positive`
--

- for `x == 9`:
--
 `Positive`
--

- for `x == -6`:
--
 `Multiple of 3`
--

- for `x == 0`:
--
 `multiple of 3`
--

- for `x == -21`:
--
 `multiple of 3`
--

- for `x == -7`:
--
 `zero`
--

- for `x == -22`:
--
 `Small negative`

--

Aaaaaand that's it!

# Strings

---

# String Basics

```python
my_str = "hello strings"
```

--

- **access**
```python
my_str[0] # h
my_str[1] # e
my_str[-1] # s
my_str[-2] # g
```

--

- **slicing**
```python
s = my_str[0:5] # s == hello
```

--

- **`len`**
```python
length = len(my_str) # length == 13
```

--

- **concatenation**
```python
new_str = my_str + " are fun" # new_str == "hello strings are fun"
```
---

# Some important points

--

- No such thing as a **`char`** in Python - only strings of length 1
    ```python
    my_char = "a"
    len(my_char) # 1
    type(my_char) # <class 'str'>
    ```



- Strings can be empty
  ```python
  empty_str = ""
  len(empty_str) # 0
  ```

--

- Strings are immutable
  ```python
  my_str = "Hello"
  my_str[0] = "h" # Error
  ```


  
---

# Some useful methods and properties

you can find all of these on devdocs.io under in the [string section](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#str)

Some examples:

--


- **Manipulation**

  - `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`
  - `strip`
  - `replace`
  - `split`
  
--

- **Testing**
  - `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isalnum`
  - `startswith`, `endswith`

--

- **Searching**
  - `find`, `index`
  - `count`

--

These are only partial examples, there are many more!

# Lists

---

# Lists

An ordered collection of items
```python
l = [1, 40, -4, 0, 365]
print(l[1]) # 40
````

- Can hold multiple types of items
  - But this is usually **a BAD idea**
- **Mutable** - can be changed
    ```python
    l[2] = 0
    print(l) # [1, 40, 0, 0, 365]
    ```

---

# Useful methods and properties of lists

- Quick copy with slicing `[:]`
  ```python
  l = [1, 2, 3]
  l2 = l[:] # this is different from l2 = l  
  ```
- check if something is `in`
  ```python
  if 1 in l:
      print("1 is in the list")

  if 4 not in l:
      print("4 is not in the list")
  ```
--

- [common sequence methods](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#typesseq-mutable) and [mutable sequence methods](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#typesseq-mutable)
--

- Additional method:  [`sort`](https://devdocs.io/python~3.10/library/stdtypes#list.sort) - **in place**

--

- `join` - **not** a list method, but a string method that takes a list as an argument, and prints it's elements with the string as a separator
  ```python
  "-->>".join(l) # "1-->>40-->>0-->>0-->>365"
  ```

---

class: center, middle, inverse

# Tuples

---

# Tuples

An ordered, **immutable** collection of items

- So it's like lists, but you can't change it
  ```python
  t = ("Michael", 35, True) # creation with parentheses
  print(t[1]) # 35          # access with square brackets
  
  t[2] = False              # Error - can't change
  ```
--

- Can **destructure** - assign to multiple variables
  ```python
  name, age, is_student = t
  print(name) # Michael
  print(age) # 35
  
  ```

--

- Can hold many types of items
  - And (unlike lists) this is usually the case
  - Usually what we get is a list of tuples...


--

- Useful functions that return tuples: `dict.items()`, `enumerate`, `zip`

## A minute to talk about
# Slicing

---

# Slicing

- Allows to create a new collection from some part of an existing *sequential* collection
  - Won't work on 'dict' and 'set'
- Creates a **new** collection and **does not** change the original

- syntax:

## A minute to talk about
# (Im)Mutability

---

# Mutable vs. Immutable

`list`s are mutable - you can change them

```python
l = [1,2,3]
l[1] = "two"
print(l) # 1, "two", 3
```

--

`str`ings are immutable - you cant change them.
```python
s = "hello"
s[1] = 't' # Throws an error
```
--
You can, however, create a new string
```python
s2 = s[:2] + "r" + s[3:] 
print(s2) # s is not "heklo"
```

# Dictionaries

---

# Dictionaries

- An associative collection of key-value pairs
--

- **Unordered** - no indexing
  - There is an ordered version in Python 3.7+ (`OrderedDict`)
--

- keys are uniques, values are not.
--

- keys and values can be of any type
  - But it's a bad idea.


### Basic usage
```python
d = {"name": "Michael", "age": 35, "is_student": True} # creation

print(d["name"]) # Michael # access is with square brackets
d["children"] = 2 # adding a new key-value pair - also square brackets

len(d) # 4 - number of key-value pairs


```

---

# Some useful methods and properties

- Testing a key:
  ```python
  if "name" in d: # checking if value in *keys*
      print("name is in the dictionary") # prints
  if "Michael" in d:
      print("Michael is in the dictionary") # does not print
```
--

- Testing and getting a value from a key:
  ```python
  d.get("age", 0) # 25
  d.get("married", False) # False - gets the default value
  ```
--

- getters:
  ```python
  d.keys() # dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'is_student', 'children'])
  d.values() # dict_values(['Michael', 35, True, 2])
  d.items() # dict_items([('name', 'Michael'), ('age', 35), ...])
  
  ```
--

- Deletion:
  ```python
  del d["name"] # deletes the key-value pair
  ```
---

class: center middle

# `str` is a weird collection!

--

It's a collection of itself...




---

class: center, middle, inverse

# Loops

---

# `while` loops

Most basic loop that every language has.
```python
while condition:
      do_something()

do_after_loop()
```

--


You can do everything with them, but they are most useful when you don't know how long (how many iterations) something is going to take

--

common uses (NOT an exhaustive list):
- Input from user ('till he gets it right')
- Endless loop with `white True:`
  - exiting with `break`


---

# `break` and `continue`

2 extra ways to control the flow with a loops

- `break` - stops the loop - the next line is the line after the loops
- `continues` - stops this iteration of the loop and goes to the next one.

--

Important notes:
- work for both `while` and `for` loops
--

- work only on containing loop - if loops are containing other loops, the outer ones are not affected

  ```python
  res = []
  while len(res) < 3:
        while True:
          input = input("what is your name?") // TODO: finish this
          if input[0].islower():
            print("Name should start with uppercase letter")
          else
  *         break    
  ```
