# Python Classes, <br/>"data struct"s and Exceptions

# Intro to OOP - what's the buzz?

There is a lot of history and opinions (go and read Robert C. Martin's "Clean Architecture").
But we will keep it simplified for our purposes.

--

- So far we used **procedural**- programming: thinking mainly about the procedures - functions - needed for our computation.
- In Object Oriented Programming we are thinking about the **entities** - objects - in our problem domain.

--

Lets talk about a restaurant kitchen example.

--

- One is not better than the other, they are just different tools that might be more suitable for different problems.
  - Some say that OOP is easier to understand and maintain.

--
- Focus on the operator, and not the operations.

---

# What we left out

--

### A lot of important things

- Polymorphism

- Inheritance
  - interface or implementation
- `static` and `class` methods.

- encapsulation - which is **really** important 

--
  - (so we'll mention it in the next slide)

--

- so much more...

---

class: middle, center

### The (soft) definition we are going to use:


# An object is a combination of **BEHAVIOR/ACTIONS** and (usually internal, encapsulated) **STATE**

---

# OOP objects vs data structures (records)



Data structures (`record`s in *C*)  **ARE NOT** OOP objects. They are a collection of related data.
--
 
- They don't have a behavior
  - they do not operate (not active), they are operated upon (passive)
--

- The data is open and public, not encapsulated

--


 So: no behavior and no internal state


--

### Example: A car vs my ID card

--

- My ID card has data: name, birth date, gender, ALIYAH date

--

- My car has
  - **Actions** (behavior, operations): accelerate, break, steer, shift-gear
  - Internal **state** - affected by the operations: is_running, speed, RPM, gear, gas levels, etc...

--

note that for my car - some of that internal state can be accessed and viewed, but I can't control the whole internal state directly

---

class: center

# Something to think about

All cars have pretty much the same *interface* (accelerate, break, steer, etc...) but different car types use different *implementations* (acceleration on an electric car is very different from a V8 engin)

---

class: center, middle

# Done with the theory.

# Questions so far?

---

# Classes: a blue-print for objects

In most normal OOP languages (unlike JS) we use a `class` as the blue-print for the objects. The class defines the object. A class

--

- Describes interfaces (what operations are allowed) - always
--

- Describes implementations - sometimes
  - Describes how a new object is created - a constructor - this is a specific implementation
- Describes internal state - sometimes.

--

Those *sometimes* are out of scope for this lesson, so for our purpose, lets say *always*.

--

Think about a car - a driver does not care about the engine (until it breaks - need to debug it) but the TOYOTA **factory** defines all the inner workings and wiring, and also the process of creating a car.

# How does it look in python?
Video game example
--

```python 
class MonsterInGame:    # class definition

  # constructor
*  def __init__(self, img: pathlib.Path, health: int, damage:int, speed: int): 
    self._img = img           # these are fields/properties/attributes
    self._health = health
    self._damage = damage
    self._speed = speed
    self._position = (0,0)    # tuple

  def move(self, direction: Tuple[int, int]):  # method
    self._position = (
      self._position[0] + direction[0] * self._speed,
      self._position[1] + direction[1] * self._speed
    )

  def position(self) -> Tuple[int, int]:  # getter method
    return self._position

  def take_damage(self, damage: int):  # sorry for cramping the methods
    self._health -= damage
  def is_alive(self):
      return self._health > 0
  def damage(self):
      return self._damage
```

---

# How to use classes?

--

```python
import random

from characters import Plater, MonsterInGame

player = Player()   # a class with an empty constructor - not args required
monsters = []
for i in range(20):
  m = MonsterInGame(
    img = random.choice(["goblin.png", "orc.png", "troll.png"]),
    health = random.randint(40, 100),
    damage = random.randint(4, 10),
    speed = random.randint(1, 3)
  )  
  monsters.append(m)
```
--

Somewhere down the line:

```python
for monster in monsters:
  if monster.position == player.position:
    m.take_damage(player.damage())  
    player.take_damage(m.damage)
  
# List comprehension. You don't have to understand it right now.
monsters = [m for m in monsters if m.is_alive()]

    
```
---

class: center

# Something to think about #2

Did you notice that the player object and the monster objects have some things in common? This makes sense, and also, interesting.


---


# Some naming conventions

- Classes names use (in most languages) `CamelCase`
  - In python variable names use `snake_case`


--

- Python doesn't have the concept of **private** (that is, internal) methods or fields.
--
 But you can use an underscore ( `_` ) prefix to signal other developers and the IDE that this should be treated as a private

--

```python
class ToyotaCorolla:

  def __init__(self, max_speed):
      self.max_speed = max_speed        # "public" field
*     self._gear = "D"  # "private" field - not in completions

  def shift_to_reverse(self, added_speed):
    if self._check_rear_sensor():
      self.beep()
    self._gear = "R"

* def _check_rear_sensor(self) -> bool:   # "private" method - not in completions
      someone_behind = do_something()
      return someone_behind
```

# Any Questions?


---

# Lets look at some familiar code

```python
words_with_s = []
for i in range(10):
  s = input("Please enter a word")
* if s.uppper().count("S") >= 1:
*   words_with_s.append(s)

while len(words_with_s) > 0:
* print(words_with_s.pop())

```


--

- So now you see, `str` and `list` (and `dict`) are all objects
  - with *shortcut* constructors.


---

# A moment to talk about `set`s

- An **Unordered** collection of **unique**  elements.
  - Unique meaning no repetition.


--

```python
# DEFINITIONS
my_set = set([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
my_other_set = {1,3,5} # don't confuse with dict definitions
empty_set = set() # you can't use `{}`
```

--

  ```python
  # MUTATIONS
  my_set.add(5) # does nothing
  my_set.add(11) # adds 11 to the set
  my_set.remove(5) # removes 5 from the set
  my_set(remove(13)) # raises an error
  ```
--


  ```python
  # TESTING
  my_set.has(4) # returns True
  4 in my_set # returns True

  ```
--

  ```python
  # Using FOR
  for i in my_set:
      print(i)
  
  ```
